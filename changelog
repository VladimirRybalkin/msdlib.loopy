- changed syntax of several command line flags
- introduced sdkonly flag which skips hw synthesis completely
- internal changes for better flexibility concerning backends
- improved logging
- renamed server and client to board and host
- provided a new eclipse setup that should work better

- fixed: hardware queues now working correctly
- fixed: known issues of Ethernet connector (esp. memory problems)
- fixed: ise 14.4 backend now uses recent core versions
- fixed: non-verbose runs should now finish correctly but still report bugs (due to parallel runs, failing of the build may take some time though)
- fixed: multiple small fixes to host-side c++ driver code
