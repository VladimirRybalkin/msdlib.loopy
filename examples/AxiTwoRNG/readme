Steps to perform for this example:

- Download and compile loopy generator (cf loopy documentation, chapter 2)
- Run loopy generator using the following command (do NOT leave out verbose parameter):

  java -jar <your compiled jarfile> -c c++ -s virtex6 -p ise14.1 -v sample.bdf

  The generator will deploy a client and temp folder.
  The client folder contains the host-side API, that can be used inside your program.
  The temp folder contains the Xilinx EDK and SDK projects.

- XPS should be called automatically and executed on the XPS project.
- XSDK will fail with a popup - skip this popup
- open XSDK using the workspace <project>/temp/sdk
- rebuild (standard ctrl+b)
- Use .bit and .elf in <project>/temp/sdk/hw (alternatively, a copy is made in <project>/server) and <project>/temp/sdk/app/Debug respectively to program fpga
- Run client application using your own main.

For convenience, a sample main has been provided as well.
