Steps to perform for this example:

- Download and compile loopy generator (cf loopy documentation, chapter 2)
- Run loopy generator using the following command:

  java -jar <your compiled jarfile> -c c++ -s virtex6 -p ise14.1 -v sample.bdf

  The generator will deploy a client and temp folder.
  The client folder contains the host-side API, that can be used inside your program.
  The temp folder contains the Xilinx EDK and SDK projects.

- XPS should be called automatically and executed on the XPS project.
- Run Xilinx SDK using the temp/sdk folder as workspace
- Import all projects in the temp/sdk folder to the workspace
- Use .bit and .elf in temp/sdk/hw and temp/sdk/app/Debug respectively to program fpga
- Run your program

For convenience, a sample main has been provided as well.
